<h2>peach</h2>

<p>The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated.[3] It bears edible juicy fruits with various characteristics, most called peaches and others (the glossy-skinned varieties), nectarines.
The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus, which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the kernel of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.[4]
Peaches and nectarines are the same species, though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. The skin of nectarines lacks the fuzz (fruit-skin trichomes) that peach skin has; a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is thought to be responsible for the difference between the two.[5][6]
In 2018, China produced 62% of the world total of peaches and nectarines.[7]Although its botanical name Prunus persica refers to Persia, genetic studies suggest peaches originated in China,[12] where they have been cultivated since the neolithic period. Until recently, cultivation was believed to have started around 2000 BC.[13][14] More recent evidence indicates that domestication occurred as early as 6000 BC in Zhejiang Province of China. The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site. Archaeologists point to the Yangtze River Valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties probably took place.[15] Peaches were mentioned in Chinese writings and literature beginning from the early first millennium BC.[16]</p>
